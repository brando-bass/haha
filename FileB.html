<p>One of the greatest actors in all of film history, Al Pacino established himself during one 
of film's greatest decades, the 1970s, and has become an enduring and iconic figure in the world
 of American movies.</p>
<p>Pacino was born on April 25, 1940, in the Bronx, New York, to an Italian-American
 family. His parents, Rose (Gerardi) and Sal Pacino, divorced when he was young. His mother moved
 them into his grandparents' house. Pacino found himself often repeating the plots and voices of
 characters he had seen in the movies, one of his favorite activities. Bored and unmotivated in 
 school, the young Al Pacino found a haven in school plays, and his interest soon blossomed into
 a full-time career. Starting on the stage, he went through a lengthy period of depression and
 poverty, sometimes having to borrow bus fare to make it to auditions. He made it into the prestigious
 Actors Studio in 1966, studying under legendary acting coach Lee Strasberg, creator of the Method 
 Approach that would become the trademark of many '70s-era actors. After appearing in a string of 
 plays in supporting roles, he finally hit it big with "The Indian Wants the Bronx", winning an Obie
 award for the 1966-67 season. That was followed by a Tony Award for "Does the Tiger Wear a Necktie?".
 His first feature films made little departure from the gritty realistic stage performances that
 earned him respect: he played a junkie in The Panic in Needle Park (1971) after his film debut
 in Me, Natalie (1969). What came next would change his life forever. The role of Michael
 Corleone in The Godfather (1972) was one of the most sought-after of the time: Robert Redford, Warren
 Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Ryan O'Neal, Robert De Niro and a host of others either wanted
 it or were mentioned for it, but director Francis Ford Coppola had his heart set on the 
 unknown Italian Pacino for the role, although pretty much everyone else--from the studio to 
 the producers to some of the cast members--didn't want him. Though Coppola won out through slick
 persuasion, Pacino was in constant fear of being fired during the hellish shoot. Much to his
 (and Coppola's) relief, the film was a monster hit that did wonders for everyone's career, 
 including Pacino's, and earned him his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.
 Instead of taking on easier projects for the big money he could now command, however, Pacino
 threw his support behind what he considered tough but important films, such as the true-life
 crime drama Serpico (1973) and the tragic real-life bank robbery film Dog Day Afternoon (1975).
 He opened eyes around the film world for his brave choice of roles, and he was nominated 
 three consecutive years for the "Best Actor" Academy Award. He faltered slightly with Bobby 
 Deerfield (1977), but regained his stride with ...and justice for all. (1979), for which he
 received another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. This would, unfortunately, signal 
 the beginning of a decline in his career, which produced such critical and commercial flops
 as Cruising (1980) and Author! Author! (1982). He took on another vicious gangster role and
 cemented his legendary status in the ultra-violent cult hit Scarface (1983), but a monumental
 mistake was about to follow. Revolution (1985) endured an endless and seemingly cursed shoot
 in which equipment was destroyed, weather was terrible, and Pacino became terribly ill with
 pneumonia. Constant changes in the script also further derailed a project that seemed doomed 
 from the start anyway. The Revolutionary War film is considered one of the worst films ever,
 not to mention one of the worst of his career, resulted in his first truly awful reviews and
 kept him off the screen for the next four years. Returning to the stage, Pacino has done much
 to give back and contribute to the theatre, which he considers his first love. He directed a 
 film, The Local Stigmatic (1990), but it remains unreleased. He lifted his self-imposed exile
 with the striking Sea of Love (1989) as a hard-drinking cop. It marked the second phase of Pacino's
 career, being the first to feature his now famous dark, owl eyes and hoarse, gravelly voice. 
 Returning to the Corleones, he made The Godfather: Part III (1990) and earned raves for his first
 comedic role in the colorful Dick Tracy (1990). This earned him another Academy Award nomination
 for Best Supporting Actor, and two years later he was nominated for Glengarry Glen Ross (1992).
 He went into romantic mode for Frankie and Johnny (1991). In 1992 he finally won the Academy Award
 for Best Actor for his amazing performance in Scent of a Woman (1992). A mixture of technical 
 perfection (he plays a blind man) and charisma, the role was tailor-made for him, and remains 
 a classic. The next few years would see Pacino becoming more comfortable with acting and movies
 as a business, turning out great roles in great films with more frequency and less of the 
 demanding personal involvement of his wilder days. Carlito's Way (1993) proved another 
 gangster classic, as did the epic crime drama Heat (1995) directed by Michael Mann and 
 co-starring Robert De Niro, although they only had a few scenes together. He returned to
 the director's chair for the highly acclaimed and quirky Shakespeare adaptation Looking
 for Richard (1996). City Hall (1996), Donnie Brasco (1997) and The Devil's Advocate (1997)
 all came out in this period. Reteaming with Mann and then Oliver Stone, he gave two commanding
 performances in The Insider (1999) and Any Given Sunday (1999).</p>
<p>In the 2000s, Pacino starred in a number of theatrical blockbusters, including _Ocean's 
Thirteen (2007)_, but his choice in television roles (the vicious Roy Cohn in HBO's miniseries
 Angels in America (2003) and his sensitive portrayal of Jack Kevorkian, in the television
 movie You Don't Know Jack (2010)) are reminiscent of the bolder choices of his early career.
 Each television project garnered him an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.</p>
<p>In his personal life, Pacino is one of Hollywood's most enduring and notorious bachelors, having
 never been married. He has a daughter, Julie Marie, with acting teacher Jan Tarrant, and a new 
 set of twins with longtime girlfriend Beverly D'Angelo. His romantic history includes a long-time
 romance with "Godfather" co-star Diane Keaton. With his intense and gritty performances, Pacino
 was an original in the acting profession. His Method approach would become the process of many 
 actors throughout time, and his unbeatable number of classic roles has already made him a legend 
 among film buffs and all aspiring actors and directors. His commitment to acting as a profession 
 and his constant screen dominance has established him as one of the movies' true legends.</p>
<p>Pacino has never abandoned his love for the theater, and Shakespeare in particular, having
 directed the Shakespeare adaptation Looking for Richard (1996) and played Shylock in The Merchant
 of Venice (2004).</p>
